AdBlocker for Facebook

Facebook recently made it harder to block its overly privacy invasive Sponsored Ads (http://www.techmeme.com/160809/p7#a160809p7).
As a bing proponent of privacy, I believe targeted advertising is messed up. If I goto Amazon and search for something, I come back to 
Facebook and see that advertising in my face. That annoys me. If that annoys you, then install this extension.

I have uploaded the extension to Google Chrome Extension Gallery, https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lbdnbdbkgccjgdoehcmojmcmnkhheknp/, 
hopefully they will approve it. Otherwise, feel free to load this into chrome://extensions

Have fun!
